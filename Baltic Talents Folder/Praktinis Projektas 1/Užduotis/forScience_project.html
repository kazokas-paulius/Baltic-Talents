                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was aim of the final project - to create a virtual reality horror game „For Science!“. The game consists of a game menu, main player, horror elements and game story. Main objectives of a game player are to explore the game environment, read hints in the game that would let the player to figure out where scientist is located, solve the obstacles in the game and the most important to stay alive. The game is created using cross-platform game engine „Unity“. To implement the game, the first person controller script „Unity Standard Assets“, as well as other game scripts using the MS Visual Studio software were used and which are created by the author of the project. Android game version is used to test virtual version of the game, as well as a smartphone Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, Android applications „VR Calibration“ to calibrate virtual reality glasses for comfortable game view and „Cardboard“ to run the game including bluetooth game controller „BM-707/BM-727“.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project consists of two main parts – game with virtual reality gear and final paper. The final paper contains the following parts: formulation of the assignment, in which the purpose of the final project, the functional, non-functional requirements, analysis of the assignment are reviewed. Analysis of the assignment presents detailed game characters and overall structure of the environmental entities diagram, use case diagram and analysis tables, the description of programming implementation, in which each component of Unity game object with the assigned script, code snippets and their explanations are described in depth,. Finally, the final project presents a user manual which describes the software specifications used during creating the game and the guide for configuring virtual reality for smartphones.

                            At the first level of the game, the player is introduced to the game environment, flashlight and batteries system and other game objects with which the player can interact. At this level, the player must turn off the gas from broken pipe to enter the second level through the ventilation system because the other way - double doors are stuck and wont let player pass through.
                        </p>

                            The player starts the level in the staionery room, which has three batteries in it. After leaving the room in corridor the player sees that he can not pass through the smoke and he's forced to go around the library to locate valve to shut gas down. The library has one jumpscare effect, two batteries and hints to solve the door code. The door code is displayed by the book shapes in the shelves of the library, the books depict the Roman numerals. The door code is 2591. Once player solves door code puzzle he may continue. Next room includes two batteries and one jumpscare effect. Further, the player has access to the corridor, this part of corridor has a security - security camera, which triggers the activation of the monster behind the player's back. Player will be chased by monster always till monster looses the vision of player for 3 seconds then monster will enters the search mode and goes in direction where he last time saw player three times. He finds player really well, you better find a good hidding spot :) After player escaped monster he has to go to the dungeon bathrooms, in which gas  valve is located. Also, the bathrooms has one jumpscare effect. After the gas is turrned off, the player is allowed to enter the ventilation system.

                            At the end of the vent, the player is teleported to the second level history level. It describes the scientist's reflections and what to expect in the second level of the game.

                            At the second level of the game, the player has to solve four game-level tasks. The main goal - the player must find the hidden elevator that leads to the scientist's room.

                        <p class="gameLevels_text">
                            At the beginning of the second level, the player notices that the passage of the corridor is blocked and abandoned level needs to switch on the electricity power supply on to open the door at the otherside of blockade. To activate the electricity power supply, you must collect the monster on the activation tile. The red color of the activation tile tells how much of the body parts of the monster remains. When the monster collected, the electrical tile is activated and it presses down. In this case, the player can press the power button in the transformer room to turn lights back on. When the light is turned on, the player can take the key in the monster's room. With the key the player can go to the lottery room, which has to solve one more puzzle. The key must be connected to a furnace-like computer that spills the cubes of the second puzzle. The numbers of cubes should be placed under the image above each rack. (from left to right) Cube 5, cube 8, cube 3. After placing the number of cubes in the correct order, the player is allowed to proceed further into the paintings hallway. In this puzzle, the player must rotate the images in order to successfully call elevator at the end of the corridor. Hints of how to rotate the paintings are shown on the board of the formula in research room. (left to right) Rotate twice, rotate once, rotate once, rotate twice, rotate once. After turning the paintings in the correct order, the player successfully calls the secret elevator. When entering the elevator, monster spawns behind player and starts to chase him, but the elevator door is tricky and closes in time.

                            Pressing the button down the button teleports the player to the third level history level. It describes the rewards of a scientist and what to expect in the third level of the game.

                            In the third level of the game, there are two main tasks to accomplish - to rescue a scientist and escape  from third level alive.

                        <p class="gameLevels_text">
                            The third level starts at the elevator. When the player leaves the elevator, he enters the monster experiment room, which contains the first monster and scientist. The player must talk with the scientist and find out what's going on in the game's dungeon. WHile talking to a scientist, the player must discover a reduction weapon, that reduces the scientists size so player could take him with him. Next, the player must escape the game at the beggining of the level one back in stationery room. First player has to go through to the second level - lift up the elevator. Upon reaching the second level, in the players UI timer appears through which player has to fit in time. The second and first game levels becomes chaotic - some book shelves fallen, flashlight turns on and of on its own. While running through second level hallways the player manifests the hallucination of the monster chasing him and causing the game walls to appear in hallways. When the player successfully passes through the second level, the second level begins to fall in the smoke and player can no longer return back. When the player enters the first level through bathrooms, white light is activated and the timmer is stopped, which symbolizes that the end is not far off. But as a player moves forward the light source, the first level bathroom jumpscare effect is played and the timmer  continues. The player must run around pass the security camera, the library, because the pipe leaks gas again.

                            Passing through the library and entering the stationery room, the player must rotate the painting, which activates the secret stairs to the good game ending. The bad game ending occurs when the player can not make it in time and rotate painting, then a monster activates next to the player who kills him.
